{% capture description %}

The **Image** feature provides the user with the ability to insert a self-contained image, that can be referenced from edited content.

The image is usually accompanied with a caption.

{% endcapture %}

{% capture ui %}

 * UI: A feature providing the user with a way to set the properties of a new image, usually represented as a button with the "<i class="fa fa-image" aria-label="Image" title="Image"></i>" icon that opens a dialog with form fields to edit image properties
 * Title: "Image"
 * Keystroke: â€“

{% endcapture %}

{% capture markup %}

The `<figure>` element MUST be used to represent the **Image** feature as it is the standard way to express self-contained non-textual additional content<sup>[[1](#ref1)]</sup>.

The `<img>` element MUST be used to represent the image itself as it is the standard way to express an image in HTML<sup>[[2](#ref2)]</sup>.

The `<img>` element MUST have at least the following attributes:

* The `[src]` attribute with a valid URL pointing to the image<sup>[[3](#ref3)]</sup>.
* The `[alt]` attribute that contains the textual alternative for the image, if any, or is empty, if the image conveys the information that could be derived from its context or caption<sup>[[4](#ref4)]</sup>.

The caption, if it is present, MUST be represented by the `<figcaption>` element<sup>[[5](#ref5)]</sup>.

Example:

```
<figure>
	<img src="http://c.cksource.com/a/1/img/sample.jpg" alt="Saturn V carrying Apollo 11">
	<figcaption>Figure 1: Beginning of Apollo 11 mission</figcaption>
</figure>
```

{% endcapture %}

{% capture implementation %}

* If the image is intended to be displayed on a wide variety of devices, it SHOULD be declaratively (as part of created content) marked as responsive. This could be achieved by using one of the following methods<sup>[[6](#ref6), [7](#ref7)]</sup>:
	* The `[srcset]` attribute added to the `<img>` element<sup>[[2](#ref2)]</sup>.
	* The `<picture>` element<sup>[[8](#ref8)]</sup>.

{% endcapture %}
