# The Editor Recommendations Project

This project aims to solve a few problems currently faced by both editor developers and implementers which are decided
to go with editing into their systems.

Check to the project website for further details:

Although the project has been bootstrapped by the CKEditor team and it will help driving the CKEditor 5 development, it
is being run in a editor-neutral way and can certainly benefit other projects as well.
