# General Policies and Guidelines

The "Editor Recommentations" project has been started with a specific goal: to make the *future* of content creation
better. It may not fit all needs, especially when it comes to things we were doing in the past.

To bring clarify to our approach to the project and to drive us on decisions, a set of policies and guidelines have been
designed and published here.
