	<h1>General Policies and Guidelines</h1>
</div>

The "Editor Recommendations" project was created with a specific goal: to make the **future** of content creation
better. It may not fit all needs, especially when it comes to things we were doing in the past.

In order to clarify our approach to the project and to help us arrive at some decisions, a set of policies and guidelines have been
designed and published here.

## Focus on Quality Content and Semantics

The Editor Recommendations project is designed for the creation of content that fits the following criteria:

 * Can be reproduced on different devices at different screen sizes.
 * Has proper semantic value.
 * Is fully accessible.
 * Is future-proof.

In other words, the goal is optimizing editors and their features to be in line with modern standards and guidelines for
content creation. Other concerns like operating system compatibility and deprecated markup are not to be taken into consideration or may be presented as side notes.

## Use of key words

The key words MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, OPTIONAL, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT are to be interpreted as described in [Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels (RFC2119)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Ctrl vs Cmd

This documentation may make references to the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> keyboard key. On Apple computers, editor implementation
should seamlessly replace it with the <kbd>Cmd</kbd> key.
