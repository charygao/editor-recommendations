	<h1>General Policies and Guidelines</h1>
</div>

The "Editor Recommendations" project has been started with a specific goal: to make the **future** of content creation
better. It may not fit all needs, especially when it comes to things we were doing in the past.

To bring clarify to our approach to the project and to drive us on decisions, a set of policies and guidelines have been
designed and published here.

## Focus on Quality Content and Semantics

The Editor Recommendations project is designed for the creation of content that fits the following criteria:

 * Can be reproduced on different devices at different screen sizes.
 * Has proper semantic value.
 * Is fully accessible.
 * Is future proof.

In other words, the goal is optimizing editors and their features to be inline with modern standards and guidelines for
content creation. Other concerns like systems compatibility and deprecated markup are not be taken in consideration or
may presented as side notes.	

## CTRL vs CMD

This documentation may make references to the <kbd>CTRL</kbd> keyboard key. On Apple computers, editor implementation
should seamlessly replace it with the <kbd>CMD</kbd> key.
