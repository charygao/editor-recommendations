	<h1>About The Editor Recommendations Project</h1>
</div>

This project aims to solve a few problems currently faced by both editor developers and implementers which are decided to go with editing into their systems.

Although the project has been bootstrapped by the CKEditor team and it will help driving the CKEditor 5 development, it is being run in a editor-neutral way and can certainly benefit other projects as well.

## Problem 1: What features to have?

A common problem for all developers wishing to have editing inside their systems is deciding which features to include with their editor of choice. This is many times driven by the one or more of the following:

 * Take everything the editor gives by default.
 * Preference for as fewer features as possible.
 * Preference for as many features as possible.
 * Personal preferences.
 * Lack of knowledge content design, standads, best practices, etc.

As a way to mitigate this problem, a set of well though "defaults" could be designed, living less room for bad decisions.

## Problem 2: How features should behave?

Editor developers, in the other hand, have to deal with a variety of possibilities when it comes to defining how features should work. This goes from UI/UX requirements to final markup produced. There are many options for each case and many times the solutions proposed are not optimal.

Our goal is entering on details about the features, defining a solid commonly accepted behavior for them.

## Participating

The most important reason to bring this project to public was about expanding the discussion to anyone interested on the editing topic. If you are on the same boat, join us now!

The project is extensively discussed at the [official Editor Recommendations repository on GitHub](http://). Everyone is welcome to open and comment on issues there.
